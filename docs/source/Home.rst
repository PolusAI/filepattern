Filepattern: A Utility for Programmatic File Manipulation
=========================================================

The ``filepattern`` Python utility is designed to extract information stored in
file names. A ``filepattern`` is essentially a simplified regular expression with
named groups, and regular expressions are valid ``filepattern`` expressions
provided they do not use groups.

The utility was born from the need to manipulate and organize image data from a
variety of microscopes, all of which have a systematic but different filenaming
conventions. This made abstracting things like image stitching algorithms easier
to apply to files with disparate naming conventions by simply changing the
``filepattern`` rather than generating new code to parse each new naming
convention. Although ``filepattern`` was born to wield against image data, it is
not limited to image data, and can handle filenames with any extension.
